            A Founderâ€™s Journey
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-primary/80 leading-relaxed">
            The idea for Zen-Guests was born on a bus ride through India. I saw a world of people living on their smartphones, demanding one-tap convenience, and our entire hospitality industry stuck in the past. Why are hotels and PGs still running on ringing phones and manual processes while giants like Zomato and Swiggy are capturing all the value?
            <br /><br />
            We founded Zen-Guests to solve this. Our mission is to empower every hotel owner in India with the tools to compete, to profit, and to deliver the world-class hospitality they are known for.
